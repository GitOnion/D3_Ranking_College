Initial Thoughts about two visualization methods.

Parallel Coordinates
Pros: Interactive, Explorative, Filtering is useful, Great for showing trends, The ability to reorder the axes is powerful and customizable
Cons: Not able to see individual data point, the filtering does not allow grouping, not good with discrete variables

Radar Chart
Pros: Very clear and good for making comparisons, simple
Cons: Only display one object/entity at a time, hard to compare across several entities

I decided to implement Parallel Coordinates first, because i want to explore the general trends of the data.

Choosing the scope of data. For parallel coordinates, I will include the following variables
- Year (2011-2016)
- Teaching (0-100)
- International (0-100)
- Research (0-100)
- Citations (0-100)
- Income (0-100)
- Total Score (0-100)
- Number of Students

Questions, what do we do about the ranking category? Possible Solution: Bin up all of them.
How do we deal with sparse data? Do we not include them?

Maybe we can couple this with a bunch of year buttons buttons?

For the RadarChart, since it's more focused on individual, I'm thinking about just presenting the top 10 schools? Or maybe we can just present comparisons
between countries.

And how they have changed through out the time by using animation?

Filters buttons for countries?
